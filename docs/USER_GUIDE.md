## Tips and Best Practices

### Monitoring Audio Levels

1. **Check regularly**: Glance at the Overview page periodically
2. **Watch for clipping**: Red indicators mean audio is too hot
3. **Verify silence**: Flat meters during expected audio may indicate problems

### Recording Best Practices

1. **Start before needed**: Begin recording slightly before the scheduled time
2. **Monitor continuously**: Keep the Overview page visible
3. **Check file sizes**: Growing file sizes confirm active recording

### File Management

1. **Regular cleanup**: Delete old recordings to free space
2. **Download important files**: Backup critical recordings
3. **Check before deleting**: Verify you're deleting the correct file

### Troubleshooting

**No audio levels showing:**
- Check if the recorder is started
- Verify the source is transmitting
- Check network connectivity

**Recording won't start:**
- Verify configuration is complete
- Check available disk space
- Review error messages

**Cannot access admin features:**
- Verify your account has admin role
- Try logging out and back in
- Contact your administrator

### Performance Tips

1. **Close unused browser tabs**: WebSocket connections use resources
2. **Use a modern browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended
3. **Stable network**: Avoid recording control over unstable connections
